# Fighter-Jet-detection-using-yolov8

This repository contains the implementation of YOLOv8 for detecting fighter jets in images. YOLOv8, short for "You Only Look Once version 8," is a state-of-the-art object detection model that can detect multiple objects in an image with high accuracy and speed.

Note: in this project, helper.py file was used. toy can find that that code https://github.com/python-dontrepeatyourself/Real-time-Object-Tracking-with-DeepSORT-and-YOLOv8

# DataSet
The model has been trained on a custom dataset containing a set of images containing fighter jets. Annotations for object detection were prepared using bounding box annotations.
